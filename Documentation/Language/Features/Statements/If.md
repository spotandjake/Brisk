# If Statements
================================================================

If statements are a key part of any language they allow the programmer to make decisions based on conditions.
Brisk `If` statements are simple there syntax is familar and very similar to other languages. 

```
if (<condition>) <statement>;
```
```
if (<condition>) <statement>
else <statement>;
```

## Caveats
If statements are special they do not start a new scope but also do not let you define a variable within them directly. You have to open a code block for that.
